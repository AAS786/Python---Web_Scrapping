**Conclusion**

In this project, I performed web scraping on Flipkart to extract information about smart TVs. The web scraping process involved navigating through the Flipkart website, extracting relevant data such as product names, prices, descriptions, and customer reviews for smart TVs.

Following the web scraping, I organized the extracted data into a structured format using Python and Pandas. This structured data provided insights into various smart TV models, their prices, and customer ratings.

For visualization, I utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots. A box plot was employed to visualize the distribution of prices and customer reviews among different smart TV models. Additionally, a scatter plot helped to explore the relationship between prices and customer reviews for a more detailed analysis.

Overall, this project showcased the process of web scraping for data extraction and the subsequent visualization of smart TV information. The insights gained from these visualizations can assist in making informed decisions when choosing a smart TV based on factors such as price and customer satisfaction.
